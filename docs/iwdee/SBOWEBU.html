    <pre>
      This slender bow radiates an intense amount of heat, yet it seems cold to the touch, as if it were draining energy from the user's body. An aging necromancer from Bryn Shander enchanted it, after his lava-mephit familiar was slain by an Aurilite high priest. The bow was then given to an assassin for hire, Teraven Docen, who was quite successful in bringing down many of the ice-maiden's children over a three-year period of bounty hunting. The assassin met his match, however, when attempting to ambush a traveling gnome who carried a wand of fireballs. Only the bow survived the repeated immolations.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Shortbows were the first bows to be developed, although they were not called such. This is more of a default term that refers to anything which is not a longbow. Shortbow staves are about five feet long on the average. As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges. Bows were either given longer staves or flexibility was increased with no change to the length. The former resulted in what is now called the longbow.
