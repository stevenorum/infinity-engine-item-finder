    <pre>
      This grim item was fashioned by priests of Myrkul, god of the dead. The heavy leather belt is set with metal plates and hoops that hold human bones. The original owner was a deadly warrior named Proud Keth. Keth rode across battlefields without fear, smashing whoever got in his way. On those rare occasions when he was surrounded, the belt came in handy. Unfortunately for Keth, his opponents eventually decided to take him down using polearms and long spears. When he was killed, his belt was buried with him. It was only a matter of time before thieves came to Keth's grave in order to loot it. One of the thieves sold Keth's belt to a practical mage from Urmlaspyr. The wizard, Isanan by name, found the belt to be very useful during his travels. When he retired, he sold the belt to a grateful priest of Myrkul named Ben-Karad. Ben-Karad is believed to have been killed somewhere in the sewers of Waterdeep.
