    <h2>Unidentified name : Lute</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Pellon Kay would never appear in history books for his musical talents. If it wasn't for his famous lute, no one would have remembered him at all. Born in Sembia and raised in a musical family, Pellon Kay never took his performances seriously. Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation. Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing. The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night. As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body. After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction. He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks. Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute. The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.

      These round-backed instruments are extremely popular in the Western Heartlands of Faerûn, crafted in Calimshan and heard as far north as Sundabar. Lutes are stringed instruments with pear-shaped bodies and fretted fingerboards, frequently played in small courts and common taverns.
