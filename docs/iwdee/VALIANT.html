    <pre>
      This legendary blade was wielded for a short time by the warrior Ilban of Elturel. It is from his exploits in Calimshan that the weapon gained its name. Before Ilban, however, Valiant was in the possession of a holy slayer from distant Zakhara. According to sages, the light sword was crafted to serve an order of assassins. Valiant's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon. The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport. The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions. Ilban's exploits took Valiant into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers, and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.

      The scimitar is closely related to the saber, a single-edged curved sword with protective hilt. The blade has a greater curve to it and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The origins of the scimitar are largely unknown; however, they have been very popular in the southern region of the Forgotten Realms.
