    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      The instrument of a beatified saint of the church of Ilmater, this harp once belonged to Sephica of Ordulin. Sephica was a bard, but she did not worship the lord of songs, Milil. Instead, she devoted herself to performing ballads to the suffering throngs of Ilmatari everywhere. She was traveling with a group of Ilmatari pilgrims when they were attacked by bandits. The bandits killed and severely injured many of the pilgrims, and they cut the strings of Sephica's harp when she tried to soothe the injured travelers. After the bandits had left, Sephica prayed to Ilmater for help in a time of crisis. When she plucked at her harp strings with her eyes closed in prayer, music miraculously poured forth and healed every person who heard it. The next day, the bandits arrived and killed Sephica for healing the pilgrims. Though she was killed, the pilgrims kept the memory of her miracle alive. Their community attempted to have her accepted as an Ilmatari saint. They succeeded in 1218 DR.

The harp can only be played by a bard of exceptional virtue, wisdom, and talent.
