    <pre>
      This weapon was fashioned by your hands, guided by the dwarf Tiernon. Forged from ice taken from the walls of the Gloomfrost, this blade has taken some of the glacier and some of your strength into it, creating a formidable weapon. Though made of ice, the weapon is only slightly cold to the touch and does not melt, even when exposed to the hottest flames.

    <pre>
      The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.
