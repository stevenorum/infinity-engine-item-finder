      Boots of Grounding: Talos's Gift
Untold years ago, the Fortress of the Starspire Peninsula was placed under the direct torment of Talos when a favored Stormherald was murdered there. Talos promised the destruction of the city by earthquakes, its isolation by tidal waves, and the death of its citizens by storms. One pair of these boots was bestowed to ensure that none but a single man would survive to tell the story of his wrath. Later, travelers seeking fortune in the ruined city came upon an aged man, maddened by the continuous destruction around him; the boots he wore would carry to many a distant land the legend of a city consumed by a god's rage.
