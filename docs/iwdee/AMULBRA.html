    <pre>
      This simple steel amulet was consecrated by priests of Tempus for use by a warrior named Teln Graham. Teln was a powerful warrior, but he was easily unnerved in large battles. This badge, which he wore over his heart, allowed him to overcome his sudden panic attacks during important conflicts. It left Teln's possession when the Tempurans decided that he was an unredeemable coward. Teln is believed to have retired from adventuring to become a farmer.
