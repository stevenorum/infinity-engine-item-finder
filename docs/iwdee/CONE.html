    <pre>
      Properly a hat, not a helm, the Cyclocone is a wizardly item of impressive power. The wizard Bemban of Immersea was known to be quite fond of these pointed hats both for their appearance and their power. Many wizards sought their own Cyclocones, but their distinctive appearance soon became the butt of many jokes among adventurers. Bemban grew senile in his later years, and left most of his fortune to private mages in the hope that they would continue to make his favorite magical hat.
