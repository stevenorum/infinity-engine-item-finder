    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      One of the only musical instruments actively approved of by the church of Tempus, the Cittern of War was constructed by a halfling instrument maker named Relias Blackseed. Priests of Arvoreen the Defender blessed the cittern with its impressive power. Relias never intended to play his magnificent creation. He eventually sold the ruddy instrument to a bard named Gallow Deely. Gallow was a lanky, slender man often found in the company of adventurers. Though ill-suited for battle, Gallow was exceptionally gifted at putting tales of heroism to music. With the aid of the cittern, he helped the Company of Frozen Trees defeat a young green dragon in 1013 DR. His song, commemorating the occasion, was a rollicking tune called "The Fight of Green Thirteen." It is played in central and western taverns to this day.
