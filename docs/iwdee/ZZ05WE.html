    <h2>Identified name : The Mace of Weal and Woe +1</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Mace</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Even without magical enchantment, this particular piece of weaponry could fetch a healthy price for its exquisite craftsmanship. The shaft of the mace is a bronze cylinder reinforced with a steel bar down the center and six thin bands of polished steel, three above the haft and three below the head. The head itself is egg-shaped and made of red-stained cherry wood reinforced by decorative arcing bronze bands. Steel flanges stick out from the head in an asymmetrical pattern. The two largest flanges bear extensive etching. One is a classical image of Tymora with the word "WEAL" in Thorass. The other is an image of Beshaba with the word "WOE." Despite the delicate materials used in the mace's construction, it is exceptionally sturdy. The history of the mace is largely a mystery.

      The mace is a direct descendant of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The head design varies; some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs.
