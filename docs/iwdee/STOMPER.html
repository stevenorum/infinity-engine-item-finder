    <pre>
      This pair of extremely sturdy boots were owned by the Thentian explorer Bordel "Stomper" Farpath. Bordel was famed throughout the Moonsea for his hiking contests. Bordel and a group of fellow explorers would specify a location in Faerûn to march to. The contestants would then hike to the location by the quickest route possible. Bordel won far more of the competitions than he lost, and he had a reputation for having extremely heavy footsteps. This earned him the nickname "Stomper." When Bordel died in a rockslide, he was buried in the wilderness. Several years after his death, rumors began circulating that Bordel's boots were actually enchanted to make him sound loud when he approached. This rumor spiraled out of control, eventually going so far as to say that Bordel's boots were capable of shaking down houses with their weight. By the time thieves stole the boots ten years after Bordel's death, they had taken on the properties that so many people believed they possessed.
