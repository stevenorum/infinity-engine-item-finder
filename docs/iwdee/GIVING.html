    <pre>
      This black and silver morning star was created by a Cormyrean necromancer called Dameth the Wan. Although it appears to be a sinister weapon, the unadorned surfaces of the morning star mask its dreadful power. The weapon was sold to a priest of Myrkul who put it to good use in his battles against adventurers. Eventually, however, the priest was overcome by a paladin of Lathander, who confiscated the item. When the mountain temple where the morning star was contained was sacked by giants in 1190 DR, the history of the weapon ended.
