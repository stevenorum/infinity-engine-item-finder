    <pre>
      A weapon of grim reputation in the Frozen North, Blood Iron was crafted by a wicked barbarian shaman named Hekedder. He gave the sword to a cousin as a gift. The weapon saw a good amount of use in various barbarian hands as the years went by. Eventually, each owner found themselves hated for having the weapon in their possession. The taint of necromancy is so deplored by the northern tribes that the cursed name of Blood Iron became common knowledge among them. To this day, barbarians will not touch the cursed weapon and dislike even speaking of it. It is crafted of crude, poorly worked iron, and the surface of the blade is covered in gouge marks and the imprint of bad hammer strikes. The grip is wrapped in bright red leather.

      The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.
