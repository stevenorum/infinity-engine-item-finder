    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      An extremely unusual mace, Three White Doves was created by an Ilmatari priest named Alledec in 850 DR. Alledec had been a fighting priest for the order for twenty years, and he decided it was time to leave a legacy for the church to use after he had passed away. This ivory-headed mace was the result. The shaft of the weapon is made from black-enameled steel, with the handle being crafted of carved ivory. Gold bands lock the head and the handle into place. The head itself is the most unusual part of the mace. It is carved from pure ivory, and it resembles three white doves facing the center of the weapon. The flared wings of the doves form the flanges.

Alledec died in his sleep three years after completing the mace. It was given to a traveling fighter in service of the church of Ilmater. The fighter later passed the weapon on to a priest of Ilmater named Recken the Bold. Recken lost the weapon when he was fighting a powerful vampire near Trollbark Forest. Recken was eventually victorious over the vampire, but he never recovered the mace.

      The mace is a direct descendant of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The head design varies; some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs.
