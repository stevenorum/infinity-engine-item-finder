    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This staff was used sparingly by priests of Moradin during their darkest hours. Enchanted by several high priests, the Staff of Moradin's Breath has resurrected some of the greatest dwarven heroes of Dorn's Deep. It was last used to resurrect Creed Dorn, killed by elven archers and mages during a battle near Kuldahar Pass. The staff was hidden in Lower Dorn's Deep to prevent it from being stolen by orcs when they finally overran the dwarven defenses.
