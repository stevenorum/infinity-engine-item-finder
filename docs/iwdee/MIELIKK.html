    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      A lesser-known weapon, historically only used by rangers serving Mielikki, this blade has a very humble and simple background. The Cradle of Mielikki was originally blessed by a triumvirate of druids for a ranger named Kell Pathwalker. Kell led a peaceful life, fending off the occasional orc or goblin who might wander into his lands. When he died of old age, the druids had no one to pass the blade on to. The oldest of them, Bimon, held on to the scimitar, but never used it in battle. When Bimon and his associates left their grove for an extended period of time, a wandering mercenary robbed the hollow tree of its riches. He carried the scimitar north to the Spine of the World, where he died of exposure.

      The scimitar is closely related to the saber, a single-edged curved sword with protective hilt. The blade has a greater curve to it and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The origins of the scimitar are largely unknown; however, they have been very popular in the southern region of the Forgotten Realms.
