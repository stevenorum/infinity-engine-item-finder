    <pre>
      Named for its ability to lay warriors low, the Cairn Blade was used by the mercenary Adal Kerrn. Kerrn was a skilled heavy infantryman. He and his company, Kerrn's Breakers, hired themselves out to all sorts of warlords, bandits, wizards, and religious leaders. They were typically placed at the front of the battlefield, where they would intercept charging heavy cavalry units and break their formation. Kerrn died in 1054 DR when he accidentally killed the horse of a heavily armored foe. The horse fell on top of Kerrn, killing him. In the madness of the battle that followed, most of his comrades were routed. Though Kerrn's body was never found, the group that had employed him at the time, the church of Helm, recovered his distinctive sword.

      The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.
