    <pre>
      This hammer was made by a self-styled prophet of providential rejection. His name was Phellep, and he believed that the actions of the individual were of no consequence to the fate of humanity as a whole. As a result, he rejected concepts of good and evil, instead adopting an attitude of enforced indifference and abstention from social, moral, and political activity. The hammer he carried with him was used to pound on the doors of churches, what he called "the dens of fools and mindless men."

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two previous examples of thisâ€”the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. (Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.) The shaft is about 18 inches long.
