    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      An extremely vivid piece of clothing, the Mantle of Hell's Furnace was woven from the beards of fiery azer. It was worn by a high priest of Kossuth named Ullabem for fifteen years before he was killed fighting a priestess of Istishia. When the priestess attempted to destroy it, efreet allies of Ullabem tracked her down and killed her. One of the efreeti kept the cloak until it was requested of him by a clever thief who summoned the genie out of an enchanted block of sandalwood. It is believed that the cloak retains its powers until they are used a certain number of times. Once that point is reached, the cloak is summoned back to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
