      Seven Eyes
(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell conjures forth seven magical orbs that float in a ring above the caster's head. Each eye has a defensive and offensive ability, though once either one is used, the eye will lose its power. The powers of each eye are described below.

Eye of the Mind: This orb protects the caster against mental attacks such as charm, emotion, and fear. The eye can be expended as the 1st-level wizard spell Charm Person, bringing a humanoid creature under the caster's control for 1 turn (Save vs. Spell negates).

Eye of the Sword: This eye deflects the first physical damaging attack that strikes the caster. The eye may be expended as the 1st-level wizard spell Magic Missile, creating up to 5 missiles (one for every two levels of experience besides the first) that each strike a target for 1d4+1 magic damage.

Eye of the Mage: This eye absorbs one manifestation of fire, electrical, cold, or acid damage. The eye can also be expended as the 3rd-level wizard spell Lightning Bolt, dealing 1d6 electrical damage per level (capped at 10d6) to all creatures in its path.

Eye of Venom: This eye halts any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. The eye can also be expended as the 4th-level priest spell Poison, dealing 20 points of damage to one creature over a period of 20 seconds (Save vs. Poison negates).

Eye of the Spirit: This eye blocks one instant-death magic attack (Death Spell; Finger of Death; Power Word, Kill; Slay Living; Destruction). The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye's power as the 2nd-level wizard spell Ray of Enfeeblement, dropping a target's Strength to 5 (Save vs. Spell negates).

Eye of Fortitude: This eye blocks one stunning, deafness, blindness, or silence effect. It may alternatively be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Shout, dealing 4d6 magic damage and deafening creatures within a 35-ft. cone (Save vs. Spell halves damage and negates deafness).

Eye of Stone: This eye shields the caster from a single petrification attack. It can also be used as the 3rd-level wizard spell Hold Person, rendering humanoids of man-size or smaller immobile for 1 round/level (Save vs. Spell negates).
