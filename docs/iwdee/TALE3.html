    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This yellowed page, although faded and frayed at the edges, is surprisingly resilient, having the texture of leather. Despite the fact it is written in an unknown script, the words on the page twist and shift as you read over them, translating into the Common tongue in your mind.

...and the third of the four Watchknights fell, 
his spear planted in the ground against
Aehirglass's charge. The dragon's wings 
were as shreds, its wounds were great, 
but the dragon knew the day was his.

It turned upon the last of the warriors, 
Erris, the fourth Watchknight. There were
no other warriors to be seen, for Lord
Maluradek had still not taken the field.
Erris rushed in to strike but was snatched
up in the dragon's grip, and the creature's
head reared back to bite the Watchknight's
head from his body.

Yet Aehirglass had not counted on Erris's
strength. Struggling against the dragon's
grip, the Watchknight cleaved through its 
neck with his mighty axe, the blade diving
into the gap in the scales of the dragon's throat
left by numerous spear and sword wounds. 

With a mighty cry to Helm, he made two blows
of one! He reversed his swing to catch the neck
from the other side as the talons crushed at him, 
and there was a twin cracking like thunder, 
as the knight's body snapped in the dragon's grip... 

... and the dragon's head lolled from the neck 
like a felled tree, then collapsed to the ground, 
raising a cloud of sand across the Storm-Barrows.

A dragon's death matched with the deaths of four
Watchknights. What can be said of such a valiant battle,
only Lord Maluradek knows. He returned many hours
after the field had fallen silent, but not a tear was
shed for his fallen guardsâ€”his eyes swam only with
gold and glory.

"The past is dust," was his eulogy to the corpses of
the Watchknights, "the road ahead is a golden one."
