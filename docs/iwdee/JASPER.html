    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      A thick steel band set with quartz, this tough-looking ring was created and worn by the Cormyrean battle-mage Jasper Silverblood. Jasper was a stocky, gruff man who appeared more like a common laborer than a wizard, and he liked it that way. He used this particular weapon on rowdy, cocky soldiers when he was confident it wouldn't kill them. He went down in history as one of the strictest disciplinarians ever to have command over the Purple Dragons.
