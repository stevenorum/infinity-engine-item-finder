      This powerful amulet was crafted by the enchanter Celemon of Calimport in 727 DR. He crafted ten such amulets on commission before jealous rivals killed him and attempted to duplicate the procedure. His colleagues were not as talented as Celemon and destroyed their laboratory and themselves when a mishap occurred. The formula was destroyed as well. This particular amulet was owned by the elven warrior-mage Pelan Rainwind. It was lost when he was killed by giants in the Spine of the World somewhere around 840 DR.
