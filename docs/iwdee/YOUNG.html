    <pre>
      This axe was crafted for a powerful young barbarian warrior named Hegelfden. He was born into the Tribe of the Elk, and the shamans prophesized that he would be a powerful warrior. Hegelfden grew up believing that he was special, important, and somehow better than those around him. By the age of seventeen, Hegelfden was an accomplished warrior. Huge, fast, and cunning, he was more than a match for his kinsmen. On a journey into the Spine of the World, Hegelfden captured two dwarves that he came across in a cave. He refused to let the two workers go until they created a magnificent axe for him. The two dwarves reluctantly agreed, creating a stout battle axe with a keen blade and a thick handle. When the dwarves asked to be released, Hegelfden denied their request. He wanted to keep them as servants. The dwarves then laid a curse upon Hegelfden. They told him that the fruit of his abuse would be the end of him. Hegelfden laughed at the dwarves' claim and continued on with his life. The next day, in a battle with a rival tribe, Hegelfden went berserk with blood lust, slaying every creature he came across. His kin, convinced that he had gone mad, cut him down where he stood. The axe was left on the field when the warriors brought Hegelfden's body back to the camp. When they arrived, the dwarves were nowhere to be found.
