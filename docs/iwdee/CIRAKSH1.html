      Ring of Invisibility: Sandthief's Ring
Held by a master thief for the better part of a generation, this ring was put to bold use in the markets of Waterdeep. Working a crowd in broad daylight, the rogue would steal countless numbers of purses from nobles, replacing them with bags of sand so the theft would go unnoticed. His identity was never known, but the name "Sandthief" was cursed loudly in its stead. It is rumored he retired and now lives among the nobles he used to rob.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
â€“ Wearer becomes invisible until an attack is made; then the ring must be removed and put on to become invisible again.
