    <pre>
      Merry by reputation and promiscuous by nature, the half-elven enchantress Pemby Cloudsilk created a great number of wands and staves in her time on Faerûn. Pemby kept this wand for herself for personal protection. When she was killed by a jealous lover in 1103 DR, she left the wand to one of her many other suitors, the thief Tamlock of Waterdeep. Tamlock avenged Pemby's death several years later when he killed her murderer with an imperceptibly poisoned blade in a duel.

      Wands are 1 1/4 ft. long and slender. They are made of ivory, bone, or wood and are usually tipped with something—metal, crystal, stone, etc. They are fragile and tend to break easily. Because of this, they are often kept in cases. 

Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item). When a wand runs out of charges, it is consumed and destroyed.
