    <h2>Identified name : Owain's Lullabye</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Wooden Shawm</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Owain's Lullabye was created by a disturbed bard named Owain Piper. Piper was a worshipper of Auril, born in the town of Silverymoon and raised to embrace the frigid environment of his homeland. He traveled extensively in the Moonsea, where he met a mage named Pelham of the Moor. Owain and Pelham became good friends and stayed in contact for over a decade. Pelham eventually enchanted Owain's Lullabye for the bard in exchange for a small sum of money. Owain rarely used the instrument in battle, typically employing it when he found late-migrating geese lounging on a lake. He would blow the horn in such a way that the geese heard it as the sound of their cousins heading south for the winter. As the geese would attempt to take flight, Owain's horn would freeze them in mid-stroke, where he would leave them to die.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This double-reed instrument creates and exotically textured sound. When played poorly, the instrument buzzes like a large insect, but in the hands of a master, the shawm has the clear, melancholic voice of migrating geese.
