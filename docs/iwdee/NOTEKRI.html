    <pre>
      Chief Krilag,

As you know by now, your master and creator is gone. Malavon, Saablic's associate, will now be handling all magical affairs in the dome north of the Artisan's District. You are the strongest of your kind, and thus it is to you that I extend Saablic's badge of lieutenancy. Use it as a symbol of the authority that I have loaned to you. If ever you and the others need to have audience with me, you must bring your badge with you. Think of it as a keyâ€”one of six keys to a lock. Do not lose it.

I am placing you and the other orogs in charge of defending the upper reaches of Dorn's Deep. It is your new home. Do with it what you wish, but always submit to my will and to the will of Ilmater. Your nearest peer is Kreg Frostbeard in Wyrm's Tooth. If you are in need of assistance, call upon him and his kin for aid. Defend the stronghold with your lives, for if you survive in failure, your suffering will be monumental.

If you have trouble understanding any portion of this letter, have Adinirahc or one of the other drow mercenaries explain it to you.

In the Blood of Our Father,
RBP
