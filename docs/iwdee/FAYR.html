      The Company of the Black Snake was a moderately powerful force around Waterdeep in the first half of the 13th century, DR. They were well known for their detailed battle tactics and organized fighting formations. When they fought especially powerful foes, their two dwarves and two halflings would rush the front to surround their target. The humans and elves would then strike with halberds and bows from the back ranks. This particular halberd belonged to Bedwyn Fayr, one of the best halberdiers in the company. The company's tactics fell apart in 1252 DR when an unknown party with superior tactics decided to take the group out. Only Fayr and one halfling, Pep Greenfields, survived the assault. Fayr and Pep decided that Tymora had given them a sign. They sold their adventuring gear and opened a profitable antique shop in Waterdeep.

      By far the oldest and most often used polearm, the halberd consists of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff averaging six feet in length. The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design. The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry. A halberd can be best described as a cross between a spear and an axe.
