    <h2>Identified name : Tome of Leadership and Influence</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Tome</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      One of the most popular recent tomes of leadership and influence is the cynically entitled book "How to Win Friends and Influence People." Like others of its ilk, it peddles a philosophy of personal ascendancy and manipulation by charisma alone. The authors and advocates of such tomes claim that, by drawing on the most recent theories in sociology and interpersonal psychology, it is possible to raise an individual's Charisma by a single point. In truth, such increases in personal charisma are as much the product of magical spells placed on the text as it is in the writing process. These same spells also cause the tome to disappear after its first use. An excellent marketing strategy, you must concede...

STATISTICS:

Charisma: Raised by 1 point permanently
