    <h1>Item code : OGIEN</h1>
    <h2>Identified name : Ogien's Scale +4</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Scale Mail</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      The great barbarian hero Ogien wore this armor during his many legendary conquests. Ogien was said to be a bear of a man, taller than his fellow barbarians and a good deal wider. It is said by some of the barbarians that Ogien would wrestle with wolves for amusement, and it is known that he was haunted by a prophecy that he would die "under white paws." When he was killed fighting polar bears on the tundra of Icewind Dale, his armor was buried with him. Despite its power, it is not distinctive in its appearance.
