    <h2>Unidentified name : Sundered Shield of Tiernon +2</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Tiernon has apparently "awoken" the enchantment that was hibernating within this shield (most likely due to the giant's fist that struck it). He has retraced the runes along the edges and redrawn the Denthelm symbol in its center. The shield seems brighter than it did before, lighter, and there is a slight vibration when it is held, as if it is humming to itself.

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: +3
– Physical Damage Resistance: +10%

Charge abilities:
– Armor Class +2 and Physical Damage Resistance +15% once per day
  Duration: 17 rounds
  Area of Effect: The wielder

– Unfailing Endurance once per day
  Eliminates fatigue
  Range: Touch
  Area of Effect: 1 creature

Requires:
 12 Strength

Weight: 2
