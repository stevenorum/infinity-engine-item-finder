      In 834 DR, a wizard named Legedain the Wiser caught a renowned thief breaking into his tower. The thief was a cynical burglar named Ilfain Blackfeather. Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body. To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem. Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby. One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it. He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword. Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat. Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks, and he threw it into the street. A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership. Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.

      The broad sword is a heavy military sword with a double-edged blade. Overall sword length is about three-and-a-half feet, and the sword is designed mostly for cutting. Most broad swords have a basket hilt or a shell guard. A favored cavalry weapon, the broad sword is known in different cultures by different names, usually dependent on the hilt configuration. The heavier blade of the broad sword makes it slightly slower and more damaging than a long sword.
