    <pre>
      This wand was once in the possession of the half-elven rogue mage Illep the Watchful. Illep, a native of Myth Drannor, used the slender ebon wand to locate the snares and springblades he often encountered during numerous burglaries. Illep was well liked by most people, but a human warrior named Brammel took offense to Illep's foppish manner in a tavern one night. Despite Illep's skill with daggers, the lithe rogue could do little to recover from the axe wound to the upper chest and neck that Brammel dealt him. Brammel was arrested by town guards, and the wand was to be returned to Illep's family in Myth Drannor. The small caravan transporting the wand was sacked by human bandits and disappeared from history.

      Wands are 1 1/4 ft. long and slender. They are made of ivory, bone, or wood and are usually tipped with something—metal, crystal, stone, etc. They are fragile and tend to break easily. Because of this, they are often kept in cases. 

Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item). When a wand runs out of charges, it is consumed and destroyed.
