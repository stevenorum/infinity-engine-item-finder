    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Worn by a series of paladins in central and northern Faerûn, this white and red enameled shield is sacred to the Trinity of Torm, Tyr, and Ilmater. The paladins found it quite useful in their constant battles against undead. Unlike priests, who often occupy a support position, paladins are expected to be at the front of most battles. This shield allowed them to fortify an area with holy magic before entering melee combat. It was most recently used by Kardod of Tyr, who was mauled to death by dozens of wights. His adversary, the necromancer Shanin, sold the shield to a friendly priest of Myrkul.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield. Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using <PRO_HISHER> shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield. Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from three to four feet in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a dragon's spread wings. A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward.
