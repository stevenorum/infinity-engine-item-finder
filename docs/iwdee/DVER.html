      This trap has left me for dead, but it's just as well. I have felt the evil within me since the moment I stepped foot in this crypt. My actions no longer my own, my thoughts confused, my will gone. Perhaps another will discover the disturbance before it manages to overcome them.

I found another route through a gaping hole in one of the prison cells in the orog-infested area above this chamber, but that led to yet more of their foul kind and a large, grotesque beast that I could have sworn was speaking with me. Perhaps the evil was within my mind even then.
