    <pre>
      A trio of wizards worked on this wand using a number of material components they had available to them and more that were relatively easy to acquire. Otterly the Rotund, Mabdek of the Seventh Star, and Yrgon the Moron only crafted the wand so they could sell it. Their long-term goal was the construction of a vast magical research facility based on the designs of the Naturalist Guild in Myth Drannor. Their wand was a greater success than their research facility.

      Wands are 1 1/4 ft. long and slender. They are made of ivory, bone, or wood and are usually tipped with something—metal, crystal, stone, etc. They are fragile and tend to break easily. Because of this, they are often kept in cases. 

Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item). When a wand runs out of charges, it is consumed and destroyed.
