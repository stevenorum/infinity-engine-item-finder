    <pre>
      The halfling warrior Ket Stillpond was known as an upright man who kept his wits about him at all times. Bards sing about the various near-death experiences he escaped from in the simple, if long-winded, tune, "The One Hundred Lives of Ket the Keen." He was also known for two of the weapons he carried. One was his short sword, Bloodfarmer. The other was his dagger, Reliance. It is said that Ket kept this dagger on his person for all of his days, never turning it over to any man, nor keeping it out of arm's reach at any time. He was actually kicked out of the Cormyrean royal court for his stubborn insistence on keeping Reliance, unbound, by his side. After he died, Ket's extremely large family decided to donate the dagger to the church of Arvoreen. The church later gave it to a promising young halfling warrior. The warrior was killed later when he turned over the dagger upon entering a seemingly friendly camp. His hosts turned out to be a pack of bandits. They killed the poor halfling on the spot.
