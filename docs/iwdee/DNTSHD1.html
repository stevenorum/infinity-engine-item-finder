    <h2>Identified name : Sundered Shield of Tiernon +1</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Shield</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This enchanted shield looks like it was punched by a giant, though to its credit, it has not only managed to stay intact, but also managed to retain some of its original magical protections. Its surface bears the maker's mark, "Tiernon," and the symbol of a dented helm—though it is hard to tell whether the helm was intended to be dented or whether the impact of the giant's fist marred the symbol.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield. Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using <PRO_HISHER> shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield. Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from three to four feet in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a dragon's spread wings. A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward.
