    <pre>
      This hammer is a byproduct of a gnomish inventor's practical joke. Apparently, an industrious little gnome was able to create a special alloy that was capable of retaining a sizable electric charge. He cleverly wove metal strands of this alloy into his leather work gloves and greeted guests with hilariously shocking results. That is until he shook the hands of a passing dwarven weaponsmith. Rumors say the shock was so intense that the poor fellow's beard caught fire. In exchange for his life, the gnomish inventor relinquished the secret to his special alloy to the dwarven weaponsmith, who now makes a comfortable living fashioning various weapons using the alloy.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two previous examples of thisâ€”the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. (Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.) The shaft is about 18 inches long.
