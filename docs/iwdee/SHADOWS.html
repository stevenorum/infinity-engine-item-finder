    <pre>
      Priests of Mask made this plain silver ring in order to help their more generous worshippers. In return, the thieves who borrowed the ring gave a portion of their earnings to churches of Mask. The ring left the church's ownership when an ungrateful thief named Jennick decided to run away with the prized item. The church of Mask hired assassins to hunt down the man and kill him, but he was never captured. It is believed that Jennick retired in Waterdeep and lived out the rest of his days in peace.
