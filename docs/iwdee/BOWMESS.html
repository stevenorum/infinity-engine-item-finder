    <h1>Item code : BOWMESS</h1>
    <h2>Identified name : Messenger of Sseth +1</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Longbow</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This wicked bow was crafted thousands of years ago for a powerful yuan-ti archer named Apali. The number of men, women, and children Apali killed with the aid of the bow is almost unbelievable, as the soldier waged war against humans for hundreds of years before he was finally laid low in Chessenta by a priest of Assuran, god of vengeance. Apali had killed the priest's great-great-grandfather in Chult over a hundred years earlier. The item is easily recognized because of the red and black banding on the grip and the carved snake heads at the ends of the bow. The red and black bandings represent Apali's family, from a caste of priests. The snake heads represent Sseth, the god of the yuan-ti.
