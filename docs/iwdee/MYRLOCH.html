    <pre>
      It is believed that fae creatures helped create this beautiful sword, and legends say that it was forged in the cool depths of Myrloch, the large lake at the center of Gwynneth in the Moonshaes. The weapon has an unearthly look to it, and it is believed to be quite old. The only individual known to have carried the weapon was a half-elven bard named Daen Winterbrush. It is said by some that after he found the sword, quite by accident, he was blessed with exceptional creativity and powerful sensitivity to the world around him. He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerûn. It is believed that Daen eventually became too melancholy at the sights of misery and oppression that he encountered in his travels, and that the fae smiths of the Moonshae Isles welcomed him into the breast of Myrloch.

      These swords are usually referred to as double-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.
