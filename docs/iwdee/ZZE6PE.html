    <pre>
      A beautiful weapon with a mocking name, Pig's Eye is an elven blade dedicated to the slaying of orcs. Although its proper name is Gruumshacan, most people who know of the blade refer to it as Pig's Eye. The name is an allusion to the fateful blow which Corellon Larethian, patron of the elven race, inflicted upon Gruumsh, head of the orc pantheon. The glass-encased orc eye that rests in the hilt makes it easy to recognize.

The blade was crafted in 239 DR by an elven enchanter and weaponsmith named Shenarr Caith. After he had finished imbuing the weapon with its power, he gave it to his cousin, the ranger Velaic Caith, who put it to extensive use against orcs near Cormanthyr. His son, Tredain, and his grandson, Galesic, also employed the blade for hundreds of years without misfortune. Eventually, the Caith family decided to make the long migration to Evermeet. As Gruumshacan was not the family's moonblade, the Caiths decided to trade the weapon for some of the funds necessary to transform their ancient uncle Shenarr into a baelnorn. The last recorded remarks from Shenarr indicate that he was more than slightly amused at how the little blade had helped him defy death.

      The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.
