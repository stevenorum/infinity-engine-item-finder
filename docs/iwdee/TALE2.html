    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This yellowed page, although faded and frayed at the edges, is surprisingly resilient, having the texture of leather. Despite the fact it is written in an unknown script, the words on the page twist and shift as you read over them, translating into the Common tongue in your mind.

...only Watchknight Giles was not 
deterred by Aehirglass's sudden charge. 
Determined to shield Lord Maluradek's flight,
he refused to give ground to the storming
beast. And so it was by keeping his wits 
about him, his keen eye saw another way the
dragon might be undone. 

With the sun high above him and mace
firmly in hand, he let the dragon's talons
rake at his tabard, exposing his shining 
breastplate to the sun. Not a drop of blood
was shed, such was the skill he had timed
the swift dragon's speed.

He turned so that the breast of his 
gleaming armor caught the sun
and sent spears of the sun's rays
into the dragon's eyes. Unprepared 
for the radiance, the lids of the beast
snapped closed, and his charge faltered,
the beast blinded!

And so with his Wits about him, Giles 
brought his great mace down upon
Aehirglass's skull, drawing the first blood of
the day...
