    <pre>
      A tough bartender in Westgate named Righteous Tad commissioned the creation of this weapon to deal with his rowdier patrons. Tad would normally pound the club against the bar if things got out of hand, but he frequently had to join the brawl to restore "order." He is said to have clubbed so many thieves over the head with the stick that no major criminal in Westgate could honestly claim they had never felt Peacekeeper's sting. One such criminal, a thug named Hellpin, took offense at the beating he received. Hellpin trained his dogs on Righteous Tad one foggy night. Tad managed to kill more than half of the canines before he was overborne and done in. Hellpin kept the club as a trophy in his hangout as a warning to those who might cross him.

      Most clubs are stout, hardwood sticks, narrow at the grip and wider at the end. This simple weapon has been used since people first began using tools. Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it, hence the club's widespread use.
