      Girdle of Bluntness: Destroyer of the Hills
Having lost friends and loved ones to a series of raids by hill giants, Garrar the Powerful made it his mission to cleanse his homeland of their presence. It is not known where he acquired this item, but with it he single-handedly dispatched dozens of the creatures, all the while protected from the blows of their clubs. The remaining giants fled to neighboring lands; lands that lacked a similar champion and did not fare as well.

      Girdles are generally similar to belts. Unlike belts, girdles are not used to hold up pants and dungarees, but to carry pouches, scabbards, and the like.
