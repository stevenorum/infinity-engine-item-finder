    <pre>
      Gond, god of invention and artifice, is a deity rarely worshipped by traditional adventurers. Some thieves, however, revere Gond for his role in the development of locks, traps, and other complex machines. One such thief was the burglar Jurmar the Calm, who began his career as a locksmith. Known for his cool demeanor and steady hand, Jurmar paid priests of Gond to fashion this tool belt for him. Whenever Jurmar was stuck in a situation where he didn't have the right tool for a job, one of the small pouches on the belt would supply him with what he needed.

      Girdles are generally similar to belts. Unlike belts, girdles are not used to hold up pants and dungarees, but to carry pouches, scabbards, and the like.
