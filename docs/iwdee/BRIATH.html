    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <pre>
      The great monument was completed today, and it is a wonder to see. If there is any doubt to the significance of my role within the Dorn community, let it now be laid to rest! There are those who find pride and glory in the chase, traveling above and underground to ensure the good fortune of our home, but I am not one of them. I must admit, I too would take up the arms should my name be called to protect those around me, but until that day, I feel myself far more resourceful creating the weapons than wielding them.

In honor of our new marvel, I have created a special blade that I will place with the other items commissioned for the monument receptacle. Should the day come the our way of life is defended by a sole survivor, he will fight with the will of many knowing that I have provided him with weapon worthy of such an honor. May this blade never be wielded, and if one day it is, may it serve its owner well.
