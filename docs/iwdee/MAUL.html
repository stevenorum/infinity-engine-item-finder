    <h1>Item code : MAUL</h1>
    <h2>Identified name : War Hammer</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : War Hammer</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two previous examples of this—the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. (Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.) The shaft is about 18 inches long.

STATISTICS:

Damage: 1d4+1 (crushing)
Speed Factor: 4
Proficiency Type: War Hammer
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 9 Strength

Weight: 6
