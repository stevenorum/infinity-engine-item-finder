    <h2>Unidentified name : Medium Shield</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Divination about this item reveals little, save that it once belonged to a woman called the Red Knight, a devoted worshipper and soldier of Tempus. A cult to the Red Knight exists in a few places around Faerûn. The little information that is known about the religion indicates that the Red Knight is a quasi-deity representing strategy and tactics in war. The faith consists entirely of small groups of Tempurans who favor the Red Knight's emphasis of military structure and order. The shield is plain in design and construction, with a small icon of a horse's head carved into the back rim of the item.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield. Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using <PRO_HISHER> shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield. Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from three to four feet in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a dragon's spread wings. A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward.
