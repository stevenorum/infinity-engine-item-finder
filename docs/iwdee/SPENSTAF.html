    <pre>
      The wizard Spendelard was famous for his extremely utilitarian spells. While he was not threatened a great deal during his life, his rare but far-reaching travels often took him into dangerous situations. A staff of his making protected him on those occasions. He eventually acquired a staff that he found more to his liking and sold his worn Protector to a traveling druid of Chauntea.
