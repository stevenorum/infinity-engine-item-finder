    <pre>
      The secret procedure for manufacturing these cards was only recently recovered by the sorceress Haelia. Blur Decks are thin ivory cards that are typically kept in a strong metal case. When the owner of the cards wishes to use them, he or she simply needs to shuffle the cards and throw one up in the air. The value of the card (unknown to the user) determines the duration of the effect. These cards used to be employed by the warrior minions of Porg the Stout. Porg's reliance on the cards proved to be his downfall when a group of adventurers, using his cards, killed him in his tower in 833 DR.

      Decks of cards are widely used across Faerûn for both entertainment and divination. The cards are typically made of ivory or vellum and kept safe from harm inside metal or wooden boxes. There are a wide variety of decks, but playing decks typically have forty-eight cards covering four suits (stones, waves, winds, and flames). Traditional Faerûnian card games include whist, poker, talison, elemental empires, old wizard, and Mac's snake.
