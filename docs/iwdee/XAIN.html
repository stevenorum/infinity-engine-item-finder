    <pre>
      Xainlaphar, a mad Red Wizard of Thay, was known for turning the skulls of his slain enemies into weapons. His most common weapon was known as the "Flying Skull." In essence, the item is not much different from the spell Skull Trap, but it is meant to be used offensively instead of defensively. Xainlaphar died in 913 DR, long before he had time to use even half of his enchanted skulls. They were claimed by his foes, a paladin and priest of Helm. They intended to destroy the items, but at least forty were stolen by crafty thieves on the way back to Sembia.
