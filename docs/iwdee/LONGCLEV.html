    <pre>
      This weapon was commissioned by the eccentric nobleman Pelp Cadari. Pelp was a friend of all chaotic priesthoods, frequently donating money to whomever he fancied at any given time. His associates and servants always kept their distance, as his wild mood swings could take him from joyous euphoria to miserable melancholy or furious rage at any moment. He paid over forty thousand gold pieces to have this halberd made, despite the fact that he only used the item to "cut" his fowl at his long dinner table. When Pelp died, he left the weapon to his pet goat, Azuth. In case of Azuth's death, the weapon would then be passed on to the first girl wearing a blue dress who entered his study. Twelve years after Azuth died, Pelp's niece, Amara, went into his study to find a book. The chamberlain of Pelp's mansion gave Long Cleaver to Amara when she turned sixteen. She sold the weapon to finance her entry into an academy of magic.

      By far the oldest and most often used polearm, the halberd consists of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff averaging six feet in length. The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design. The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry. A halberd can be best described as a cross between a spear and an axe.
