    <pre>
      This chess piece is a white bishop, crafted from soapstone. It is one of the many lost pieces from the fabled Chess Sets of Niri Alud. Niri Alud was a conjurer from Tethyr who loved playing chess. He frequently traveled with chess sets on his numerous voyages. He wanted the ability to summon allies at a moment's notice without giving away his intention. For that reason, he created a wide variety of chess sets of different colors that would summon constructed, golem-like automatons to aid him in battle. Almost all of Niri Alud's chess sets were lost when he was attacked by desert raiders in Calimshan. The raiders, ignorant of the ways of magic, let most of the chess sets sink into the desert sands. The chess sets that were taken were soon separated, pieces traveling through trade and theft over hundreds of miles. Treasure hunters search for the pieces still.

      Chess is one of the "four universal games" (draughts, dice, and Talis cards being the others). Many believe chess to be the most challenging and intriguing of the four games. Chess pieces and boards are often made from a wide variety of materials. Marble, wood, and ivory are the most common materials used for the construction of chess pieces.
