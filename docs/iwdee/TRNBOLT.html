    <pre>
      These crossbow bolts are easy for magic scholars to recognize because of their purpose and their colorful decoration. The infamous Band of the Key was a group of occultist fighters who dedicated themselves to taking evil magical texts out of the hands of those who would use them to cause harm. The Band favored using crossbows over bows for their ability to remain cocked and ready for long periods of time. The leader of the Band, a thin, mustachioed man named Heglyf, enlisted some Deneirrath priests to craft these special bolts in large quantities. They can be easily recognized by their distinctive yellow and green fletching.
