      A powerful gnomish hero, Harl Jamison, used this sling in his numerous battles with the ogres and goblins that infested his homeland. Jamison was the head of a famous band of gnomish adventurers called the Sons of Green Hills. The Sons are heroes to most gnomes and live on in various folk songs and legends. Jamison's sling was buried with him when he died of old age in 845 DR. It is believed that human thieves plundered his grave some years later, around 890 DR.

      Slings have existed since the beginning of recorded history. The basic sling consists of a leather or fabric strap with a pouch for holding the missile. The weapon is held by both ends of the strap and twirled around the wielder's head. When top speed is attained, the missile is launched by releasing one of the strap's ends.
