    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      The god of fire, Kossuth, rarely takes physical form in the Forgotten Realms. On those rare occasions when he does, however, destruction lies in his wake. He was summoned in 801 DR by a large collection of faithful followers who plead that they needed their god's aid to defeat a colossal octopus threatening a temple on the coast. Kossuth appeared in a gigantic bonfire and did battle with the enormous supernatural beast. The god's avatar triumphed over the octopus, but the monster did manage to damage Kossuth's essence. The divine fire raced through the creature's body and lodged in one of the creature's eyes, quickly transforming it into a bizarre black sphere lit by the flame within.
