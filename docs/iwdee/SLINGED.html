    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      The halfling warrior-rogue Edley Bramble was the owner of this fine weapon. Edley was a villain to some, but a hero to many more. Despite the fact that most halflings publicly regard Edley as a scoundrel and bad influence on halfling culture, many secretly revere and admire him. Edley's pranks and adventures among humans and elves are recorded in some of the folk songs created by Waren Blackbird.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Slings have existed since the beginning of recorded history. The basic sling consists of a leather or fabric strap with a pouch for holding the missile. The weapon is held by both ends of the strap and twirled around the wielder's head. When top speed is attained, the missile is launched by releasing one of the strap's ends.
