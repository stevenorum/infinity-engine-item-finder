    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This once-shattered blade lay in the breast of Icasaracht, the last of the white dragon matriarchs that ruled the Spine of the World. It was wielded by Aihonen, a distant ancestor of Jhonen the fisherman in Easthaven—the sword has lain at the bottom of the lake for almost a century, waiting to be returned to one of its wielder's bloodline. The blade seems to draw its strength from Lac Dinneshere itself. As long as the wielder is within a dragon's flight of the lake (a considerable distance by most race's standards), the blade is a fearsome weapon. 

The dwarven smith Tiernon has "soothed" this blade—apparently, he was the one who forged it in the first place. His skills have awoken some of the blade's original powers that had been drained when it was used to slay Icasaracht.
