    <pre>
      This short sword was crafted by highly skilled halfling weaponsmiths in conjunction with three priests of Urogalan, the Black Hound. The priests of the god of the dead commissioned and enchanted the sword for a famous halfling adventurer named Eriadon Oakhollow. Eriadon was well known for his fight against those who would defile the tombs of his people. The sword has a dull, even blade with deep engraving on one side. The engraving is in Thorass and lists, in various tables, all of the days of a tenday, months of the year, cycles of the moon, major halfling festivals and observances, and the years of Eriadon's life. The other side of the blade simply features the maker's mark, a black hound's head, and the words "THE SWORD OF DAYS." Tarnished silver in the engraving lines keeps the words and images dark. Upon Eriadon's death, the sword was passed on to a traveling priest of Arvoreen the Defender who is believed to have died fighting goblins in the High Moor.

      The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.
