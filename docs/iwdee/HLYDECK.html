      "Holy Chaos!" is a little-known card game played between priests of chaotic gods. Priests of Tymora and Umberlee are particularly fond of it. The game features four suits: Smiling Ladies, Black Bessies, Storm Queens, and Joy Bringers. The "rules" of the game are incredibly complex and are revised every year in an edict by the church of Beshaba. Winners of annual tournaments receive magical versions of the deck, such as this one. The decks are despised by the churches of Tyr and Helm.

      Decks of cards are widely used across Faerûn for both entertainment and divination. The cards are typically made of ivory or vellum and kept safe from harm inside metal or wooden boxes. There are a wide variety of decks, but playing decks typically have forty-eight cards covering four suits (stones, waves, winds, and flames). Traditional Faerûnian card games include whist, poker, talison, elemental empires, old wizard, and Mac's snake.
