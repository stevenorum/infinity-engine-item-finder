    <pre>
      This mage, who made his home in Phlan, was known as "Kedl of the Three Rings," for it was said that he perfected a technique whereby he could wear three magical rings simultaneously. An enchanter of items, he was well known for his discriminating taste in clothing, jewelry, and other accessories. His polished silver bracers were a constant part of his wardrobe. Kedl eventually sold his bracers when he needed the money for some powerful rings. Unfortunately, Kedl died in an orc attack on Phlan several years later.
