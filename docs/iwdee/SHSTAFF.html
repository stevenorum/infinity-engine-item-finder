    <pre>
      Made during the golden age between the elves of the Seldarine's Hand and the dwarves of Dorn's Deep. This staff was carved and shaped with the utmost care and then etched with elven runes across its length. Although most of the Hand's wizards chose not to engage in melee combat, they wielded this staff as a symbol of power and unity.
