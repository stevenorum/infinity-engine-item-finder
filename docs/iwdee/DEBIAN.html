    <pre>
      Rods of smiting are extremely uncommon weapons, though they can be very useful against some foes. This particular rod was last in the possession of a priest of Gond named Debian of Urmlaspyr. Debian was an eccentric adventurer who took it upon himself to investigate every type of golem that had been reported in the Realms. In many cases, the creator of the golem would send his or her creations after Debian for his snooping. Debian usually escaped without much personal harm. Unfortunately for Debian, his luck ran out when he investigated the lair of the Machinery Man, a bizarre lich who happened to be a creator of golems and other animated constructs. The Machinery Man's lab full of iron golems proved to be too much for Debian to overcome.

      Most clubs are stout, hardwood sticks, narrow at the grip and wider at the end. This simple weapon has been used since people first began using tools. Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it, hence the club's widespread use.
