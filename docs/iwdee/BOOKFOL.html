      An excerpt... 

"...our principle stance is one of rejection. The fundamental beliefs of the churches of fury are anathema to our own. The Gods of Fury stress everything that is selfish, physically abusive, and destructive. The Malarites care only for proving their temporal power through the senseless butchering of animals. The Aurilites seem to delight in causing death by freezing whenever possible, removing every shred of heat from their domains. Priests of Talos simply revel in destruction for its own sake and their own personal pleasure. Our brothers and sisters in the church of Umberlee cause havoc with the waves for the sole reason of terrifying travelers and fishermen into bowing before their childish god. As much as we Eldathyn might denounce the beliefs of these religions, there is an even greater question to be asked. What kind of afterlife can these self-serving priests expect to find in the domains of their self-serving gods?"
