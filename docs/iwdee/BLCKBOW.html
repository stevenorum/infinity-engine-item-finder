    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      A rough bow with a dusty appearance, the Black Bow was created as an instrument of vengeance by a Cormyrean settler in the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn. A former soldier named Jonan of Suzail, after years of campaigning in the name of the crown, finally returned home to marry his childhood sweetheart. Through all of his years in the military, he remained true to his love and saved his earnings. He and his new wife moved west in the hopes that they would find frontier land to settle. In the lands north of Baldur's Gate and east of the Trollbark Forest, Jonan built his home and farm. Within five years, there were raiders in the area, and farms were being destroyed all around Jonan's. Eventually, the raiders targeted Jonan's home, killing his wife and child and leaving him for dead. His farm was burned to the ground. Weeks later, Jonan crafted this bow and rubbed the ashes of his farm and family into the grain of the wood. He later went on a murderous rampage, slaying each of the bandits where he found them, and later killing anyone they associated with. Sages debate how the bow became enchanted, but most believe that, after Jonan's death, it was blessed by a god. Some say it was blessed by Tyr, some say by Hoar, and others say by Bhaal. Theories tend to revolve around whether the speaker believes Jonan's actions were just, vengeful, or murderous.
