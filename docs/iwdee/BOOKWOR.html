      Worship in the Hand
By Denaini

...day in and day out, the Elves of the Hand worked diligently to further the cause of the Alliance. Although dedicated to their work, they always remained devout to the elven gods. A shrine was created within Solonor Tower that would allow us elves to offer simple worship with what spare moments were available.

A beautiful flower garden can be found on one end of this level. With care, an elf would take a flower from the garden, approach the appropriate statue of the god they wished to pray to, place the flower in the statue's pond, and pray for however long they had.
