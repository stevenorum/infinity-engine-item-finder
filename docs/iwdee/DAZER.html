    <pre>
      A powerful weapon created by the wizard Retland of Westgate, Dazer was typically used by thugs in said wizard's employ. Despite Retland's high education, he was little more than a racketeering boss and thug. His gang, the Cobble Boys, intimidated and oppressed various neighborhoods of Westgate for a decade until a wizard in service of Tyr, Alistar Lavell, rallied his allies against Retland's cronies. When Alistar defeated Retland and his gang, he turned Dazer over to the church of Tyr, where it was given to a traveling priest.

    <pre>
      Most clubs are stout, hardwood sticks, narrow at the grip and wider at the end. This simple weapon has been used since people first began using tools. Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it, hence the club's widespread use.
