    <pre>
      The quick-witted warrior Seldon Mirai was known for his cool demeanor and his lighthearted comments in the midst of trying circumstances. He was especially well known for his lack of fear of the undead. He considered undead to be, in his words, "unoriginal, tired old jokes." "After the hundredth skeleton," he would say, "what's to be afraid of? They all march at you like horses to water, and you just hack them down one at a time. I'm supposed to be scared of that?" He would wade into tombs with his trusted flail and smash apart any undead that he found, joking all the way. Eventually, Seldon's lack of respect for the necromantic arts earned him an enemy in the form of Tiron, a lich of no small power. Tiron captured Seldon and paralyzed him, letting a group of skeletons beat him to death. Seldon's friends later recovered his body and had him raised from the dead. He was not as lighthearted about the walking dead after that.
