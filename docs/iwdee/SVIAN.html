    <pre>
      A massive club, this weapon used to belong to the powerful barbarian warrior Svian of the Elk Tribe. Svian was a grim man, tall and wiry, who was known throughout the north for his dire disposition and serious manner. In battle, unlike his kin, he rarely became excited or panicked. He simply held his ground and destroyed everyone that came near him. It is said that when Svian was mortally wounded, he simply walked over to a nearby rock and sat down, never indicating that he was suffering. It was several hours before his kinsmen realized that he was dead.

      Most clubs are stout, hardwood sticks, narrow at the grip and wider at the end. This simple weapon has been used since people first began using tools. Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it, hence the club's widespread use.
