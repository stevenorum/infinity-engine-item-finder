    <h2>Identified name : Gauntlets of Elven Might</h2>

    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      These slender steel gauntlets were crafted by the elven smith Idrial Ashleaf and enchanted by his brother, Beldan. The pair gave the gauntlets to their cousin, Galain, when he alone returned from a failed quest to destroy a venerable green dragon in the forests of what are now known as Amn. The three elves made a pact to avenge their kin in ten years time. The subsequent adventures of the trio were immortalized in Merador of Waterdeep's epic "Three Avengers" ballads. The songs, sixteen in number, tell all of the adventures that the group went on. From "The Ballad of the Goblin King" to "The Ballad of Green Night," every deed is retold. Unfortunately, the history of Galain's gauntlets end with the final bars of "Green Night." The rest is shrouded in mystery.

      Gauntlets are armored gloves. They can be made of leather, metal plates, or chain mail. Every suit of armor is assumed to include gauntlets of an appropriate type. Magical gauntlets tend to be finer, lighter, and more easily worn than normal varieties.
