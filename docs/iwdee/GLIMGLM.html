    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This heavy cloak was once owned by the gnomish warrior Glimglam. A rare hero among his people, Glimglam scoured gnomish lands for giants and goblins, felling them all wherever he found them. This particular cloak was made for him by his wife, Enetta, and blessed by the church of Garl Glittergold. When Glimglam was killed by a fire giant king, Enetta stitched a crude red heart onto the breast of the cloak. He was buried with it. Twenty years after Glimglam died, human thieves robbed his grave and stole the cloak. Those thieves later sold the cloak to ogres in exchange for wine and traveling rights through a particularly dangerous portion of the High Moor.
