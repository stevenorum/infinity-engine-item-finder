    <h1>Item code : VIRGIN</h1>
    <h2>Identified name : Wailing of Virgins</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Cloak of Woven Hairs</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This thin cloak appears frayed at first, but upon closer inspection, the stray threads are actually human hairs from which the cloak is woven. The cloak twists in torchlight, each strand of hair raveling and unraveling about the others so subtly that it appears as if a light breeze is rippling the cloak.

This cloak is woven from the hair of virgins sent to the Burial Isle to sleep with their dead barbarian lords. It was the Seer's duty to comfort these women, to soothe their pain—in order to do so, she took a lock of hair from each and wove the strands into a cloak that would draw the spirits of fear from the virgins and steady their hearts. The result was a cloak that hangs heavy with guilt and does little to shield the wearer from the cold of the North. 

When worn, the hairs weave around the wielder's frame, the long strands lacing together like threads on a loom. The cloak will not willingly unravel itself from a wearer without being coerced by a Remove Curse spell.
