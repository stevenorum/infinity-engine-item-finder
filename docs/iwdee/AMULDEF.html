    <pre>
      This type of amulet takes the form of a sculpted beetle and is typically only found in areas around Mulhorand. This particular scarab was crafted in Thay by Gulvak Anrak, a powerful enchanter of magical protective devices. Gulvak gave this scarab to an apprentice, Alik Banom, who was killed by Cormyrean soldiers in 1021 DR. According to sages, Alik started a fight with a Cormyrean knight who insulted Thay and the Red Wizards as a whole. Even though Alik was powerful, he was no match for the throng of Purple Dragons that came to the knight's aid.
