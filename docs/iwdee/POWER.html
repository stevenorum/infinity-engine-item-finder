      The temple of Loviatar in the Vale of Wailing Women, called the Black Spires of the Maiden, has always enjoyed the freedom from good-aligned churches that so many other evil temples long for. However, the large temple requires a huge body of standing soldiers to protect it from attackers and spies. The head of the temple guard is known as the Whip of Obedience. He used to be traditionally equipped with a magical halberd called the Icon of Power. When the temple guards saw the Icon pass them on their rounds, they took a little more care in their duties. Unfortunately for the Whip, a clever human thief from Elturel decided to capture the Icon as a personal challenge. The thief, whose name is still unknown, succeeded at his task and sold the Icon to the church of Bane. The Banites held the Icon out of contempt for the late Whip's incompetence. Eventually, the Icon was lost when the desert temple where it was held, the Obsidian Chapel, was sacked by Bedine raiders.

      By far the oldest and most often used polearm, the halberd consists of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff averaging six feet in length. The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design. The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry. A halberd can be best described as a cross between a spear and an axe.
