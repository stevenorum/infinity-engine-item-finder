      This weapon was used by a well-known Zakharan gambler named Kadan Ibn-Kadur. It is believed that the blade helped Kadan win many foolish bets that he should have lost. Kadan parted with the weapon, however, when he crossed paths with the infamous Nido Ochita Inazuma in western Faerûn. Inazuma was the son of a Cormyrean knight and a Kara-Turian noblewoman. He claimed that his mother was struck by lightning twice while she was pregnant with Inazuma—once when she learned she had conceived and again immediately before she gave birth. Legends say that Inazuma was born on the edge of the Fateful Coin, the mystical method by which Tymora and Beshaba decide whether a person will have good or bad luck throughout his or her life. Sages believe that Inazuma's coin landed on edge, making him immune to the effects of weal and woe. When he came across Kadan and his scimitar, it was only a matter of time before the Zakharan gambled his scimitar and his life into Inazuma's hands.

      The scimitar is closely related to the saber, a single-edged curved sword with protective hilt. The blade has a greater curve to it and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The origins of the scimitar are largely unknown; however, they have been very popular in the southern region of the Forgotten Realms.
