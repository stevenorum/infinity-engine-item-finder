      An excerpt... 

"...we Eldathyn believe that the only real way to live honestly is to resist the temptation to strike out in anger when things are against us. Violence arises from suffering and, as a result, can do nothing but cause more suffering in its occurrence. Some of our critics point to the state of nature to invalidate our philosophy. Some believe that the existence of storms and tremors in nature proves that nature is inherently violent.

There is a simple argument against this, however. Nature is a gift from the gods, but it functions as an independent system, a science, if you will. Nature is not inherently violent because disposition towards violence is a property only thinking beings possess. While there are violent acts in nature, nature is not inherently violent. Nature is simply nature..."
