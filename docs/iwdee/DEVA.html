    <h2>Identified name : Mace of Disruption +2</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Mace</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead. Any such creature hit by it not only feels the sting of weapon, but also has a chance of being simply blasted from existence. There are legends that speak of a priest so holy a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians.

Now that the mace has been coated with illithium, it is even more potent, conferring to its user immunity to the life-draining powers of the more powerful undead.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      The mace is a direct descendant of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The head design varies; some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs.
