      Named for its ability to make its victims "push up daisies," this crossbow was used by renowned mage-killer Vicalet Hawkeye. Vicalet was a half-elven mercenary who hired himself out to various adventuring companies as support. He would trail or flank his employers in dangerous environments and shoot any and all mages that he saw. A few mages even tried to use Projected Images to fool Vicalet, but the crafty half-elf always saw through the ruse. Vicalet retired a rich man, and opened a vineyard for himself and his family. He later sold his crossbow to a young, cocky human mercenary. It is believed that the new owner was not as skilled or as crafty as Vicalet, and came to an untimely end.
