    <pre>
      This highly prized ring is made from simple jade to hide its powerful magic. Crafted by the wizard Bil, the shield ring is plain and functional. Bil, a sardonic mage of otherwise small repute (creator of such spells as Bil's Fantastic Ale and Bil's Blasting Ball), found the ring to be incredibly useful against the enemy mages he frequently fought. When Bil disappeared from the Realms twenty years ago, his ring was one of many items he left behind to his friends and associates. Because many of his friends and associates were larcenous thugs, it is assumed that the ring was sold to the highest bidder as soon as possible.
