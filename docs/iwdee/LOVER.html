    <pre>
      Fehll Brownbriars was a half-elven thief of notoriety in Waterdeep. His list of conquests, both romantic and larcenous, was too long for even bards to recite. The dagger he kept at his side was decorated with a ruby heart, and it became coveted by a small group of rivals in the great city. Fehll was eventually murdered at the hands of a seductress so clever that not even the prescient half-elf could see her malicious intent. The woman, Prespera of Orlumbor, sold the dagger for a hefty sum and disappeared into obscurity.
