      An excerpt... 

"I am simply an amateur when it comes to botany, but I daresay that I know my way around a patch of ivy better than the next man. Most botanists will attempt to tell you 'rules' about how one should care for their ivy. Unfortunately, these bumbling buffoons haven't spent enough time researching all of the different types of ivy to learn their subtle differences. Why, just the other day, some fool on the hill told me that jangling bell ivy should be planted in relatively moist soil next to blossoming garters. As any ivy scholar worth his weight in dirt knows, blossoming garters require such a huge amount of water that one would drown the jangling bell just by tending to the garters. 'Moist' does not mean 'soaked.' I ask you, what will it take to educate these comical jesters of the scientific community?"
