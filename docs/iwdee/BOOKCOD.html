      Code of Training in the Seldarine's Hand 
By Kaylessa

The Code

            Death to all who oppose our cause
                    Battle is the test above all
       Bring glory to the Hand of the Seldarine

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every person under my tutelage will be instructed as follows:

You will learn every aspect of each melee weapon I present to you. You will become familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon and learn how to utilize it effectively.

You will also learn the ways of archery. Patience, discipline, and focus will be your guide. This promise will be your commitment to hitting any target no matter the difficulty.

As a soldier serving the Seldarine's Hand, you will conduct yourself in a proper manner befitting an elf at all times. Disobedience will not be tolerated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My Oath

What these values represent is your commitment to the Seldarine's Hand and yourself. 
The promise I make is to hone your skills, both physical and mental, to bring honor to our brothers and sisters.

For the glory of the Hand,
Kaylessa
