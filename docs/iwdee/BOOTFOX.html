    <pre>
      These gaudy red and green boots were worn by the rogue Elpham of Perrywine. Elpham was a pickpocket of exceptional talent who pressed his luck by taunting his victims shortly after taking their loot. After being caught twice, Elpham invested his money in having these boots made. Of course, Elpham came to an untimely end when he picked the pocket of the notoriously ill-tempered Red Wizard of Thay, Xain Morobdel. Elpham stole a pouch full of gems off of Xain's waist and danced off into the crowd shouting, "Why don't you try to chase me back to the Priador, baldy? Ha ha!" Xain, quietly fuming, promptly summoned four invisible stalkers and commanded them to "kill the idiot in the red and green boots."

      Boots are normally hand-made by cobblers. Common boots are made by using a form, but good boots are designed for the foot of an individual.
