    <pre>
      This weapon was made by a halfling priest of Brandobaris who was terribly afraid of spiders. The halfling's name was Caligope, and his greatest enemy was an evil elven wizard named Eil-Makar. The wizard's tower was surrounded by a hedge maze filled with giant spiders. The elf's tower was also filled with a variety of abnormal spiders. For over a year, Caligope refused to even look at the tower. Eventually, he decided to construct a club to deal with his fear. The resulting weapon was named the Evil Spider Crusher of Doom. Caligope succeeded in his quest to rob Eil-Makar blind, and he left dozens of dead spiders in his wake.

      Most clubs are stout, hardwood sticks, narrow at the grip and wider at the end. This simple weapon has been used since people first began using tools. Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it, hence the club's widespread use.
