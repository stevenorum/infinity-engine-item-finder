    <pre>
      This notched and tarnished blade once saw a great deal of service in the employ of Kath Tahl, a warlord and bandit who roamed the countryside of the western heartlands. Kath was fond of destroying peasant militias to send a warning to other communities. He used this sword to that end. When the nervous defenders tried to form a line of pikes, Kath and other heavily armored men would wade into the fray, hacking their weapons apart and breaking their formation. Once the villagers had been sent into disarray, his men would fall in with cavalry and take what they wanted. Kath eventually met his end when a rival warlord, Marhap the Blackbeard, destroyed Kath's army.

      The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.
