    <pre>
      Created for a wild mercenary named Bael Cooper, the Blade of Bael had a short and violent history. Bael was the rowdy, hotheaded son of a cooper, and he did all he could to get out of his small town of Soubar and head for Baldur's Gate. When he arrived in Baldur's Gate, he hired himself out as a mercenary, thug, and caravan guard, quickly earning a reputation as an incredibly unreasonable and hot-tempered man. Within his first six months in Baldur's Gate, he had been arrested five times and was known to have almost killed at least four different people who accidentally looked him in the eye for a moment too long. Somehow, however, Bael attracted a small following of easily impressionable thugs who joined him on his seedy adventures. Eventually, Bael managed to scrape together enough money to pay a wizard to craft a powerful sword for him. The Blade of Bael aided its owner well until the mean-spirited brute decided to rough up and harass a young priestess of Eldath. When local Tempurans heard what Bael had done, they descended on him in the street and beat him with clubs, then threw him into the bay. They took his sword to their temple and later auctioned it off to a worthy owner.

      The broad sword is a heavy military sword with a double-edged blade. Overall sword length is about three-and-a-half feet, and the sword is designed mostly for cutting. Most broad swords have a basket hilt or a shell guard. A favored cavalry weapon, the broad sword is known in different cultures by different names, usually dependent on the hilt configuration. The heavier blade of the broad sword makes it slightly slower and more damaging than a long sword.
