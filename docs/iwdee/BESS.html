    <h2>Identified name : The Love of Black Bess +3</h2>

    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This fell weapon was crafted by a beautiful and cruel wizardess who worshipped the lady of misfortune, Beshaba. Her name was Redani, and she was known both for her powers as an enchanter and a seductress. The Love of Black Bess was always given to her favored consort at any particular time. Unknown to her lovers, she would place a Ring of Readiness on the mace, saving the matching ring for a special time. When she grew tired of her consorts, as she always did, she would give the matching ring to a new lover and send the young man out to kill her old paramour. The new lover would simply call upon the ring and the mace would fly to his hand. 

Unfortunately, Redani was done in when she trusted the wrong man to kill her old lover. Gural of Chessenta, a well-disguised priest of Hoar, took it upon himself to gain vengeance for a man whose skull he had picked up by the side of a road. Unluckily for Redani, priests of Hoar will go to any length to avenge the dead, even if it means animating all of her dead lovers to tear her limb from limb.

      The mace is a direct descendant of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The head design varies; some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs.
