    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <pre>
      While the front and back of this heavy-bound book is of a tarnished bronze, its spine is nothing more than rotting cords of hemp strung through the covers and thick pages within. Despite the tarnished surface and the drapery of cobwebs covering this manuscript, the writing within appears to have survived time's passage without fading. 

"My audience with Lord Maluradek went poorly. No sooner had I voiced my request than the Lord flew into a rage. He threatened to lock me in the dungeon with the treacherous bard should I broach the subject of unsealing the crypts again. I returned to the chapel shaken, and my eyes fell upon the symbol of Helm upon the tablet. I fear I have failed my god by not protecting the Watchknights' reputations.

"My Lord's anger at my request has no foundation that I can see, and I find I am now suspicious about what transpired in his battle against the blue dragon at the Storm-Barrows. The four Watchknights who died aiding their lord against such a beast should be accorded honors, not secreted away like skeletons of ill-omen. A castle built upon such crumbling foundations cannot hold.

"I must make amends, do honor to the fallen Watchknights, but I fear to do so without angering his lordship. He of the Unsleeping Eye, the Vigilant One, My Lord and God Helm is the champion of all guardians—yet which do I guard: the reputation of those brave Watchknights that gave their spirits in Helm's service, or the interests of my Lord?

"And of the bard in the dungeons; what crime did he commit that angered... nay, terrified... my Lord so? The Lord has gone so far as to issue a decree that the bard's name shall not be spoken or transcribed. Even hinting at the minstrel's presence in the dungeon is now just cause for Maluradek to punish the transgressor, as one of the poor guards learned a fortnight ago. It seems as if the Lord wishes to erase the bard from history itself. What is it he fears so?

"What tales might the Watchknights tell had they lived?"

* * *

"A plan of action has been discussed with the Adepts at the chapel, and our hearts are in agreement; we shall construct a hidden vault to honor the knights. We shall conceal our efforts from Maluradek, and guard the vault with six keys fashioned from our ceremonial breastplates. We melted each piece of armor down to forge the sextet of keys: copper, bronze, electrum, silver, gold, and platinum. With these keys, we shall be able to enter the Watchknights' crypts and pay our respects while obeying Lord Maluradek's order that the crypt itself remained sealed. 

"Yet my heart is not eased by this act; adhering to the word and not the spirit of my Lord only drags my own cowardice into the light. Yet I can find no true path between Maluradek's wishes and defending the reputation of the Watchknights. I feel as if my spirit is splayed upon a forked road, and I fear the branching shall tear me in two."

* * *

"I heard the bard's song again today from the dungeons. He sang, his voice strong and proud, through the hours of the high sun, through the twilight, and deep into the night before the Lord finally gathered his royal guards and unlocked the dungeons. Not long after their descent below the castle, the singing was silenced, and many of the guards looked pale when they emerged from the dungeon. Lord Maluradek held a bloody dagger in his hands, and his countenance was that of one near the brink of madness. 

"I should have taken action when I saw the Lord and his guards make their way into the dungeons. Now another corpse lies with the four Watchknights."

* * *

"A terror haunts the night. Strange sounds, ghostly shapes, and echoes of the bard's song have been heard throughout the castle. Whatever transpired in the dungeon between the bard and Maluradek has damned this castle and all its inhabitants. The Lord has sealed himself within his chambers, and many of his servants and guards have either left the castle or have vanished.

"I have nowhere to go, so I have stayed. A great weight hangs on my heart, for Helm made his displeasure known to me. As I stood before the offering bowl that holds the symbol of Helm and recited the evening prayers, the waters of the bowl turned dark and cloudy. I placed my hand in the waters to retrieve the symbol, but my hands found nothing. The symbol was gone.

"I felt a spear enter my heart at this; the Vigilant One has seen my cowardice. He has judged me. I am condemned, unworthy to serve as High Watcher—unworthy to live.

"I have made sure that the doors to the chapel are unlocked. Whatever darkness now haunts the night, I await its judgment.

 – High Watcher Ammal-Matis"
