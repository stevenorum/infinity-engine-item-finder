    <pre>
      A gift to the cruel warrior Eled the Desecrator, this flail appears to be mundane in most respects. The only unusual thing about the construction of the weapon is the fact that its head is made from solid granite. Eled was a champion of the evil races, and he defended them whenever the races in question had enough gold to spare. One such group of evildoers was a group of maedar and medusae that paid Eled with this flail. Eled used the weapon with frightening efficiency for the rest of his days.
