    <h1>Item code : ZZM5MH</h1>
    <h2>Identified name : Misery's Herald +3</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Flail </h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This flail was consecrated by priests of the great orc god Gruumsh for use against the various elven and dwarven foes that his armies fought against. It was held by the high priest of the Bone Legion until he fell while leading his people against the elven forces at the Hand of the Seldarine. The flail is simple in design. The shaft is crafted to resemble an elven femur and wrapped in tanned elf skin. A stout chain connects the shaft to a spiked ball. The entire creation is forged out of meteoric iron. It is a testament to the potential of orcish craftsmanship.
