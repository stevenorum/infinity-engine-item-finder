    <pre>
      Cloaks of invisibility are very popular among thieves and adventurers in general. Unfortunately, they are also very expensive. The wizard Cheston of Procampur decided to make some money when he set out to make this particular cloak for the Waukeenar priest Betrand of Suzail. Betrand used the cloak effectively until he came up against a demonic foe that could see right through the illusion. Betrand's body was never found, but the tattered cloak continued to work wonders for Betrand's comrade, the thief Dacon Blackwood. Dacon eventually ran afoul of a thieves' guild in Sembia. He was believed to have escaped their wrath by traveling to Berdusk. How this cloak arrived at its recent resting place is unknown.
