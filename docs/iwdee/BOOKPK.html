      A story... 

"Two chaste shukenja were walking down the road in the rain when they came across a beautiful young woman taking shelter under a tree. She called out to the monks to carry her across a small stream. The first monk immediately moved to help the woman while the second silently protested. The first monk scooped the beautiful lady up in his arms and carried her across the stream, promptly setting her down and continuing on his way. The second monk remained silent for several minutes as the woman disappeared from view. Finally, he spoke to his brother.

'We shukenja are not supposed to have contact with women! Why did you pick that woman up so casually and carry her across the stream?'

The first monk replied,

'Brother, I set the woman down long ago. Why is it that you have not?'"
