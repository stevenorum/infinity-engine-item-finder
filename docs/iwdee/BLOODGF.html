    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This weapon was fashioned by your hands, guided by the dwarf Tiernon. Forged from ice taken from the walls of the Gloomfrost, this hammer has taken some of the glacier and some of your strength into it, creating a formidable weapon. Though made of ice, the weapon is only slightly cold to the touch and does not melt, even when exposed to the hottest flames.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two previous examples of this—the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. (Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.) The shaft is about 18 inches long.
