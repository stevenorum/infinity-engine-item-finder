      A halfling warrior named Kim Marchwatch used this potent weapon against the giants that frequently plagued his homeland, hitting them in the head with so many rocks that they fell over in pain or ran away. When Kim was replaced as shire-reeve of his homeland, he became a reluctant adventurer. He is believed to have been swallowed up by the dreaded Fen Mists of Acallo in 760 DR.

    <pre>
      Slings have existed since the beginning of recorded history. The basic sling consists of a leather or fabric strap with a pouch for holding the missile. The weapon is held by both ends of the strap and twirled around the wielder's head. When top speed is attained, the missile is launched by releasing one of the strap's ends.
