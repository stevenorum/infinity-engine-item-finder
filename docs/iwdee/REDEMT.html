    <pre>
      This war hammer was enchanted by the church of Torm to return charmed wayward combatants to their standard allegiance. High priests of Torm typically held the hammer in battle, keeping an eye out for anyone who might be swayed to attack his or her comrades through magic. Redemption was lost when the last high priest to hold the weapon, Ardo Meller, was killed in the Battle of Black Lawns, 1230 DR. It is believed that agents of the draconic god Tchazzar dragged the weapon from the scene.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two previous examples of this—the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. (Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.) The shaft is about 18 inches long.
