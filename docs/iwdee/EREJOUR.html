      An excerpt... 

"Tomorrow I will attempt to climb through the mountains near Kuldahar Pass. In a way, I feel like I should help Hrothgar and the others in their investigation. After all, they have very little protection should monsters be in the area. Bah! Perhaps my brothers are right. We elves were not meant to interfere in the world of men. These lands may once have belonged to our people, but that was long ago. It is the territory of the wild Reghed barbarians and the Ten Towns now. Why resist the tide against us? Those who do often turn to the darkness of war and conquest to reclaim the lands that we once ruled. It is an endeavor doomed to failure. Oh, there I go again. Corellon help me, I'm starting to sound like cousin Xan!"
