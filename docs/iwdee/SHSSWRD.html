    <pre>
      Made during the golden age between the elves of the Seldarine's Hand and the dwarves of Dorn's Deep. The craftsmanship of this short sword is of exceptional dwarven quality and is laden with elven runes across its glowing blade. There were swordsmen within the Seldarine's Hand who preferred the quickness and balance of a short sword. This was made to accommodate those swordsmen who preferred to deliver death through quickness and grace rather than brute strength.

      The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.
