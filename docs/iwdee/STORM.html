      This weapon is holy to warriors in the service of Talos, god of storms and destruction, and has seen decades of use in their capable hands. A shortbow made of many composite layers of wood, the Storm Bow has been used against the myriad enemies of the church of Talos. Most recently, the bow was in the possession of a Storm Knight named Kalassan Brevered, who was killed after striking down a number of rangers and druids on the Moonshae Isles.

    <h2>Unidentified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      Shortbows were the first bows to be developed, although they were not called such. This is more of a default term that refers to anything which is not a longbow. Shortbow staves are about five feet long on the average. As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges. Bows were either given longer staves or flexibility was increased with no change to the length. The former resulted in what is now called the longbow.
