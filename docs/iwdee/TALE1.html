    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This yellowed page, although faded and frayed at the edges, is surprisingly resilient, having the texture of leather. Despite the fact it is written in an unknown script, the words on the page twist and shift as you read over them, translating into the Common tongue in your mind.

...and it was then, Aehirglass rose from its desert berth, 
sand cresting around the azure wyrm like a storm, 
its wings beating like the sails of a mighty sea vessel,
scouring the dust bowl with thousands of teeth, 
each a grain of sand, swift and deadly. 

The fear that had gripped Lord Maluradek 
fell upon our hearts as well, with such weight
we wished to turn our horses and flee with our Lord
to the East, to seek safety within the castle walls.

But then came the crashing of the bravest of
the Watchknights, Geddian, his great sword 
ringing against his shield. The sound gave us
pause and drowned out the roaring of the 
dragon and the wind. The clashing of metal
beat a hymn to Helm, and courage filled our hearts.

"To me, my brothers," he cried. "Steel your 
hearts and raise your weapons! This beast 
shall not take usâ€”our lives for our Lord!"

And thus, bolstered by Geddian's sword-drum, 
we held fast as the beast looped into the sky,
circling our band. Fear rained from its body
yet fell harmlessly upon us like drops of water...
