    <pre>
      This deadly wand was crafted by the wizard Hegthen to protect him from his rival's fire-using minions. Hegthen made frequent use of the wand during his protracted war with his enemy. After ten years of hounding, Hegthen decided to take the battle to his rival, defeating him in one of the most spectacular magical duels ever seen in Suzail's history. As his terms of victory, Hethgen demanded that his enemy's name be magically snuffed out of the memory of all who knew him. His enemy accepted and later went on to become the Cloaked Flame, a dangerous terrorist killed by Cormyrean Purple Dragons and War Wizards in 1212 DR.

      Wands are 1 1/4 ft. long and slender. They are made of ivory, bone, or wood and are usually tipped with something—metal, crystal, stone, etc. They are fragile and tend to break easily. Because of this, they are often kept in cases. 

Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item). When a wand runs out of charges, it is consumed and destroyed.
