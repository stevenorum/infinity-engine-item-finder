      The wizard Epp the Foolhardy crafted this blade for his trusted companion, Farl Greenbog. Farl was a smart ranger who had dedicated his life to eradicating trolls from the northern reaches of Faer√ªn. With Epp to help him, Farl was very successful at driving the beasts south. Farl was killed when a group of troll shamans caught him by surprise. Epp responded to Farl's cries for help only moments too late. The wizard avenged his friend's death but only reclaimed this sword from the deep pits of the marsh.

      Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. The bastard sword has a double-edged blade and a long grip, which can accommodate both hands if preferred. The overall length of the bastard sword ranges between four feet and four feet ten inches.
