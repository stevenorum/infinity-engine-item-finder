      There are a small number of these valuable gold and crimson robes floating around the Realms, and all of them are the creation of an abjurer named Delgam of the Many Hands—so called for his extensive use of the expression "on the other hand..." Delgam eschewed imbuing his items with offensive powers or other miscellaneous magic effects. Instead, he focused on what abjurers tend to focus on: defense. His robes were extremely popular, so much so that mages were coming to him from all over the world to demand that he make more for them. Delgam decided to fade into obscurity rather than cater to packs of power-hungry wizards. His robes are his most well-known legacy.

      Since the age of Netheril, mages have learned to bestow a wide variety of magical properties upon the everyday objects that surround them. A favorite item of such enchantment is the common robe. It is lightweight, affordable, and holds its enchantment well, thereby making it ideal equipment for a mage. Due to their magical heritage, however, only single-, dual-, and multi-class mages may wear these enchanted robes.
