      A fallen paladin called Matthain "Blackwatch" used this weapon to kill one hundred and one knights of his former king. Matthain's family, Chamberlain, had a long tradition of producing paladins of Tyr. Matthain's father, Garlan, slew a powerful high priest of Bane who had been posing a threat to the kingdom. The priest's evil magic brought him back from the dead. This priest, called "the Chamberlain Haunt," cursed the Chamberlain family to only produce stillborn children until he had been appeased. Matthain, as the heir to the family, took it upon himself to remove the curse. The Chamberlain Haunt told Matthain that he must kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Matthain began his grim task, slaughtering every knight he came across. He brought the skull and shield of each warrior to the Chamberlain Haunt as proof of his deed. The king dispatched bands of knights and heroes to kill Matthain, but he proved too difficult a foe. Finally, after three years of murdering, Matthain had killed one hundred knights. He told the Chamberlain Haunt that it was time to end the curse. The Chamberlain Haunt corrected him, reminding the fallen paladin that he had to kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Overcome with misery and regret, Matthain nodded and immediately threw himself on his own spear. With Matthain and Garlan dead, and the letter of his requirements fulfilled, the curse was ended and the Chamberlain Haunt was called to Acheron by Bane, screaming all the way.

      One of the earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end. When the civilized races mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel. Having reached this end, weaponsmiths began experimenting with different types of spearheads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.
