      The story of the ascension of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul, the gods of strife, murder, and death, is well known among learned men across the face of Faerûn. Despite this, most theologians know very little about what happened to the unfortunate dying god whom the malefic trio consumed prior to their encounter with Jergal. What is known is that a small portion of the dead god's essence found its way to the Astral Plane, where it coalesced into one of the smallest islands of slain divinity. This small hunk of rock and odd ore was captured hundreds of years later by an enchanter named Merdros. Merdros's duergar servants created this blade for the wizard's most powerful warrior ally. Owners of the blade claimed that they could feel the dead god's final memories flowing through the weapon when they held it.

      The broad sword is a heavy military sword with a double-edged blade. Overall sword length is about three-and-a-half feet, and the sword is designed mostly for cutting. Most broad swords have a basket hilt or a shell guard. A favored cavalry weapon, the broad sword is known in different cultures by different names, usually dependent on the hilt configuration. The heavier blade of the broad sword makes it slightly slower and more damaging than a long sword.
