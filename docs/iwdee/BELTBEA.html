    <pre>
      Priests of Helm in Berdusk consecrated this belt and gave it to the warrior Thom Wainwright, who had performed a number of great services for the church, including the destruction of the Unseeing Eye and the cult that followed him, the Blinded Acolytes. Thom wore the girdle proudly until he fell into severe debt in his later years. To his undying regret, he auctioned it off to a well-known priest of Mask.

      Girdles are generally similar to belts. Unlike belts, girdles are not used to hold up pants and dungarees, but to carry pouches, scabbards, and the like.
