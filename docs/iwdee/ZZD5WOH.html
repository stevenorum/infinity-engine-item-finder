      Shaped by a powerful djinni sorcerer on the Elemental Plane of Air, the Wind of Heaven was a gift for the caliph of Tamjuhk. The caliph claimed it was the finest weapon he had ever held. When Tamjuhk was sacked by efreet, githyanki, salamanders, and other malicious creatures, the efreeti Amir Talmed presented the weapon to the Grand Sultan of the City of Brass. Some time later, the Grand Sultan gave the weapon to Memnon, the efreeti who did battle with the djinni Calim over present-day Calimshan. Memnon used the weapon very little, deigning to give it to a powerful lieutenant. When Memnon and Calim fell to elven high magic, their servants fled or were driven back to their home planes. It is believed that the Wind of Heaven found its way back into the hands of the djinn after the epic war.

      The scimitar is closely related to the saber, a single-edged curved sword with protective hilt. The blade has a greater curve to it and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The origins of the scimitar are largely unknown; however, they have been very popular in the southern region of the Forgotten Realms.
