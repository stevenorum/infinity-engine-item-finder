    <pre>
      The mage Gullwyn was a seafaring merchant who always respected the mighty power of the ocean. He had seen many of his crewmates go flying overboard during horrible storms, lost in a split second of fear. For that reason, he developed his now famous blade, the Dagger of Safe Harbor. The weapon saved Gullwyn's life on at least three occasions. When he retired from his life at sea, he gave the weapon to a friend from Mintarn named Valkur.
