    <pre>
      This shiny brass sword is extremely old, dating back at least three thousand years before Dale Reckoning. It was created by a Netherese archmage named Pouldinus as a gift to a warrior friend. This friend, Kalamnin, was a strict devotee of Amaunator, a harsh, unforgiving god now almost forgotten by sages. Amaunator was the god of law and the god of the sun. He required his servants to follow his edicts exactly. Kalamnin did his best to observe Amaunator's laws in his travels. The blade was lost when Kalamnin was killed in battle by dozens of nycadaemons. The sorcerer who summoned the creatures, Ylmandi, kept the blade in his family until the fall of Netheril.

      Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. The bastard sword has a double-edged blade and a long grip, which can accommodate both hands if preferred. The overall length of the bastard sword ranges between four feet and four feet ten inches.
