    <pre>
      Kerish,

Kreg Frostbeard is dead, no thanks to you, and I now hold his badge of office. I, Joril Frostbeard, am now numbered among the six chosen of the master! Once my plans have come to bear fruit, I will have access to the master himself. You would do well to remember that from this day forward, worm. 

Also know that your lack of aid has not gone unnoticed. Only your silence in not reporting this to the master has kept you alive. When the time is right, *I* will tell the master that I have taken my father's throne. Until then, you will remain silent or you will die. Those walls you hide behind will not save you from my wrath. Betray me and I will crumble them about you and crush the life from you!

Joril
