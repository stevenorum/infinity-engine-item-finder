    <pre>
      This armor was made by the dwarven smith Karador and an elven enchanter known as Elameth of Five Trees. During the time of cooperation between the Hand of the Seldarine and Dorn's Deep, many wondrous items were produced. This suit of armor was one of them. Exceptionally light and beautiful, the armor was originally worn by a female elven marshal in the Severed Hand, which is why the orcs didn't take it when they sacked the towers. The armor was later stolen from the Hand by Maiden Ilmadia.
