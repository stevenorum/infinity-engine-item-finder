    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      A powerful mage enchanted this ring to prevent petrification under the breath of his prized herd of gorgons. Zilzanzer the Magnificent raised gorgons for their blood, which he sold to safety-conscious castle owners who used it to block ethereal travel. Zilzanzer was petrified over a dozen times, each time being brought back by his faithful assistant's use of Stone to Flesh scrolls. Zilzanzer eventually decided that he should make an item to protect him from petrification. The result was the Ring of the Gorgon. Sages believe that Beshaba must have smiled upon Zilzanzer when he was born, for he was turned to stone when he put on the ring. His assistant dutifully read the Stone to Flesh scroll, bringing Zilzanzer out of his stone form. Unfortunately, Zilzanzer died in the process, this time forever.
