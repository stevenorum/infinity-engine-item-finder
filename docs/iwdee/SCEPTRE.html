    <pre>
      Owned and enchanted by an archetypical priest of Bane, the Scepter of Tyranny was at the forefront of many terrible battles. Archendros of Bane was a snide, malicious man of almost perfect mental and physical abilities. He could be found leading groups of impressionable young fighters, rogues, and other assorted thugs in press gangs wandering Waterdeep. Faced with opposition, Archendros would simply employ the power of the black and red scepter and urge his minions into the retreating crowds. The charismatic Banite was eventually killed in battle by a priest of Torm and his paladin comrades.

      Most clubs are stout, hardwood sticks, narrow at the grip and wider at the end. This simple weapon has been used since people first began using tools. Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it, hence the club's widespread use.
