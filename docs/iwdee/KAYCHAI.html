    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      This armor was worn by Kaylessa, weapons master of the Seldarine's Hand. Her prowess in archery only bested by her beauty, Kaylessa was devoted to honing the battle skills of any elf under her. If there were any heroes at the Battle of Seldarine's Hand, Kaylessa was one of them. She was a shining example of courage in the face of impending doom as she fearlessly led her people against orc and goblin hordes. Even after the fall of the Hand, her commitment to battle and her people remained strong in her. Her last wish was to die in glorious battle.
