      Kheros the Red wore this blood-red suit of plate mail through many of the years that he fought for the church of Tempus. He was born as the son of humble farmers near Calaunt. When he was a young man, he set off for the city to hire himself out as a mercenary. After a number of successful endeavors, Kheros became a short-term member of many adventuring companies. Along the way, despite his many victories, Kheros became disgusted and terrified by the sight of blood.

His fear eventually spiraled out of control, consuming him with madness. Priests of Tempus found the huge warrior and took him into safekeeping. The priests believed that they could cure Kheros of his fear. Over several years, Kheros learned the ways of the Tempuran religion, eventually becoming a priest. His final step in overcoming his fear was being submerged in a tub of blood until he almost drowned. All the time he was held down, he never struggled, flinched, or tried to escape. In his later years, he had a suit of armor made to remind him of his past.
