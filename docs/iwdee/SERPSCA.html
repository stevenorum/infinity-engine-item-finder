    <h2>Identified name : Oil of the Serpent's Scales</h2>
    <h2>Unidentified name : Potion</h2>
    
    <h2>Identified description:</h2>
    <pre>
      The creation of this useful oil is quite dangerous, involving the extraction of venom from five live ophidians and the removal of twenty or more scales from each of the same. The scales are left to soak in a mixture of venom, ground poppies, and a variety of other strange ingredients for a full month. At the end of this time, the scales are burned and rolled in another mixture of oils and powders until it takes on the consistency of thick butter. A variety of spells are then cast upon the mixture to give the oil its full powers. When used, the target's skin becomes tough, green, and scaly. While the oil is extremely useful, it takes a full round to adequately smear it over the recipient's body.

STATISTICS:

Special: Target has +2 Armor Class for 6 rounds (non-cumulative)
Takes a full round to use.
